# Mutant_generator
Program in python to generate mutans
We can divide the program mutants into two categories based upon the possible number of substitutes available for a fault. In the first Class of mutants, we consider the faults for which the possible number of substitutes are fixed (finite). For example, possible mutants for a relational operator '<' are only the five other operators from that group ( `>',`<=',`>=',`==',`!=',  ) without inducing any syntactic error. 
In the second Class of mutants, the possible number of substitutes are numerous (not fixed). For example, for a constant change fault, the number of mutants could be generated by changing constants are numerous and the range depends on the size allocated by operating system.  We have considered mutants from both the categories in our proposed approach.

class1
1. Arithmetic operator replacement(e.g., `+' in place of `-' and vice-versa)
2.  Logical operator replacement(e.g., `||' in place of `&&' and vice-versa)
3. Relational operator replacement(e.g., `>' in place of `<' and vice-versa)
4. Increment/ Decrement operator replacement(e.g., `++' in place of `--' and vice-versa)
5. Bitwise operator  replacement(e.g., `&' in place of `|' and vice-versa)
6. Shift operator replacement(e.g., `<<' in place of `>>' and vice-versa)
7. Assignment  operator replacement(e.g., `*=' in place of `/=' and vice-versa)

Class2
1. Statement missing
2. Statement addition
3. Swapping of `if-else' statement 
4. Variable replacement(e.g., `a= b+c' instead of `a=d+c')
5. Sign inversion(e.g., `a= b' instead of `a=-b' and vice-versa)
6. `return' Statement Replacement(e.g., `return(1)' instead of `return(0)' and vice-versa)
7. `continue' Replacement by `break' and vice-versa
8. `switch-case' Statement Mutation
